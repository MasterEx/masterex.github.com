        <title>Some retro technology! ZX Spectrum</title>
        <link>http://masterex.github.com/archive/2011/11/20/spectrum-zx.html</link>
        <description>The first computer I've used and I remember (8-bit game consoles don't count)
was a *386* running *MS-DOS* and *Windows 3.1*. However, before that my
parents have got a very cool computer! That was a *Sinclair's ZX Spectrum*.</description>

        <title>Java: A simple and neat cli Progress Bar</title>
        <link>http://masterex.github.com/archive/2011/10/23/java-cli-progress-bar.html</link>
        <description>Back on June c00kiemon5ter wrote a cli progress bar in java. As it seems
it isn't something difficult but I find it pretty usefull and worth to
be mentioned. The progress bar was originally written as part of F.I.C.</description>

        <title>Trackable File Distribution - a simple approach</title>
        <link>http://masterex.github.com/archive/2011/10/09/trackable-file-distribution-a-simple-approach.html</link>
        <description>Let's asume that we have a community or something that distributes
material such as pictures, pdf's e.t.c. by a website to it's registered only
users. If the _management_ wants only the registered members to download
the material is it possible to somehow track a member who leaks
something in another public mean such as uploading it to a public place
or redistributing it via torrents?</description>

        <title>PHP: Protect the c0d3</title>
        <link>http://masterex.github.com/archive/2011/08/27/php-protect-the-code.html</link>
        <description>Protecting the PHP code I wrote has passed my mind in the past but
never actually bothered me because the code I have wrote was either
open source  or hosted in a self-administrated enviroment.

Anyway, as it seems many people are interested in protecting their
code from distribution without their permission.</description>
