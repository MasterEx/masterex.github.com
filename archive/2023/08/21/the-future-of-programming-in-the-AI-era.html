<h2 id="_the_future_of_programming_in_the_ai_era">The future of programming in the AI era</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>2023</strong> is undoubtedly the year of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"><strong>AI</strong></a>.
Decades of research in the field have been put into products that became mainstream such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT">ChatGPT</a>.
All the big players are running to <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tech-giants-are-in-a-race-to-dominate-the-<strong>AI</strong>-frontier">get a piece of the pie</a>. It is a new kind of gold fever.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>While the future of <strong>AI</strong> seems bright there is still much skepticism about what this will bring to the future.
This also brings the dreadful question "Will software engineers lose their jobs because of <strong>AI</strong>"? A thought that doesn&#8217;t seem so
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/12kee2p/will_ai_replace_software_engineers">uncommon</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In this article I am going to talk to you about how I think <strong>AI</strong> will affect programming in the upcoming years.
I am getting a bit late to the party. There are many articles on the internet that already discuss this topic.
However, I felt I needed to share my thoughts about this.
It is mostly <strong>speculative</strong> but I hope you will <em>enjoy</em> it.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_essence_of_programming">The essence of programming</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages">numerous</a> programming languages over the years. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language">generic languages</a> build to tackle any kind of problem and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific languages</a> that are better for specific tasks.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Most</em> general purpose languages are Turing complete and this means that they are equivalent.
This brings the <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/262424-why-are-there-so-many-programming-languages/fulltext">question</a>, <em>why do we need so many languages?</em> Why don&#8217;t we have only one language that will do everything we want?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The answer is that while the languages are equivalent they are not the <strong>same</strong>.
Two <strong>key</strong> differences are the following:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
They differ in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressive_power_(computer_science)">expressiveness</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language">Lower</a> level languages are harder to use because they aren’t similar to the human language while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language">higher</a> level languages are closer to the way humans talk and think.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In that sense generative <strong>AI</strong> can be considered just as another type of programming language. Actually, it may be considered as the most <strong>high-level</strong> language that transforms the natural language instructions to the desired programming language. Think of it as a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler">transpiler</a> if you like. A human, the programmer, will still have to explain to the <strong>AI</strong> what it needs to be done.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Of course this is not a one time job. A program will evolve in many ways during its life-cycle and
it will need maintenance. The programmer will be necessary for all of this.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_impact_of_ai_on_programming">Impact of AI on programming</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What will change is that programming will be easier. It will be trivial for someone inexperienced or unspecialized to implement an idea and produce an actual program.
So, <strong>the entry barrier to software development will get lower or even lifted</strong>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Professional developers will be more <strong>productive</strong>. This is something that already happened in the past with <strong>high-level</strong> languages, so it is only logical to happen again now.
It means that less developers will be required to produce the same amount of work.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Finally, this probably will increase code quality. Software will have less bugs and this
will make it easier to maintain. Code quality affects <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3540250.3558940">productivity</a> too.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_job_security">Job security</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As you can see, it is expected programming to become <strong>easier</strong> but it is unlikely to become <strong>fully automated</strong>.
Programmers will have to adapt to a new way of working but this is something <strong>common</strong> for the field.
New technologies appear all the time and <em>aqcuiring new skills is already an essential part of the job</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Furthermore, there are other less technical factors that we should take into account.</p></div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_ai_adaptation">AI adaptation</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Changes take time</strong>. My estimation is that generative <strong>AI</strong> will start to be used as a tool to help programmers and people in general to perform their day to day tasks. We already see many applications towards <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">this</a> direction.
Eventually, we will come to the point where we will be able to develop a product by expressing all the requirements in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language">natural language</a> but this will take time to become production ready.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This change will be adopted first by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech">big players</a>. All the other will follow on their own pace.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There will be a <em>couple of decades</em> until this becomes <strong>industry standard</strong>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Consider for example two programming languages that most of us consider <em>dead</em>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOl">COBOL</a>.
<strong>Fortan</strong> was first released in <strong>1957</strong> and the latest stable release was in <strong>2018</strong> while
<strong>COBOL</strong> was released in <strong>1959</strong> and the latest stable release was in <strong>2023</strong>!
If you search for <a href="https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=fortran+programmer%252C+cobol+programmer">job</a> postings you will find that there is still demand for both of them!</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Another example is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> which is a modern and popular language. The latest release is <strong>21</strong>.
However, in <strong>2022</strong> version <strong>8</strong> released in <strong>2014</strong> <a href="https://newrelic.com/resources/report/2022-state-of-java-ecosystem">owns the <strong>46.45%</strong> of the total usage</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You see that for a number of reasons <em>adoption of new technologies in the industry is</em> <strong>slow</strong>. Big tech companies are
always the early adopters and the ones who actually drive the field but for the rest of the world
keeping up with the changes is not so easy.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some reasons about smaller companies not being able to keep up are:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Uncertainty that the investment to a new technology will pay off
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Lack of experienced people who can lead the transformation
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Licencing or other costs that make a new technology unapproachable
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Effort to migrate existing/legacy projects is too high and make such an endeavor unattractive
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is why <strong>I</strong> beleive that it will take us <em>a couple of decades</em> until <strong>AI</strong> becomes <strong>industry standard</strong>.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_human_factor">The human factor</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Another point worth mentioning is that even if we get to the point where we may
develop an application in natural language and we could have only
business analysts that gather requirements and feed them to <strong>AI</strong>, <em>eliminating</em>
the programmers altogether is unlikely.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The is a variaty of reasons this is not feasible.</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Someone has to be <strong>accountable</strong> for the <strong>quality</strong> of the outcome. When programmers are writing code it is a
common practice to <strong>review</strong> it for issues. Somenone has to be able to review
the <strong>AI</strong> generated code and this person has to be able to write such a code
in order to be able to review it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Maintainance</strong> and <strong>support</strong>. <em>Failures will happen</em>. At the time a critical
system fails it will be very difficult to handle the incident without any human
at all. What if the crash is so big that the <strong>AI</strong> assistant isn&#8217;t working too?
Having capable human engineers involved will be irreplaceable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Copyright</strong> issues and <strong>code diversity</strong>. Generative <strong>AI</strong> creates new code based
on a dataset it was trained on. At first there will be copyright issues which
eventually will be handled by techniques similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)">code obfuscation</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_anonymization">data anonymization</a>. However,
<strong>AI</strong> generated code will still be similar in nature. The lack of <strong>diversity</strong> will
<strong>decrease</strong> the software <strong>resiliency</strong> to flaws and bugs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Special</strong> kind of problems. There is a <strong>niche</strong> where a problem is very unique,
a new algorithm has to be designed or there is a very specific and uncommon
performance constraint. The generatibe <strong>AI</strong> will not be able to handle this kind of issues
where truly original work is required.
<strong>Specialists</strong> will always be in demand to tackle the <strong>hard</strong> problems.

<h2 id="_the_rest_of_the_it_professions">The rest of the IT professions</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Until now I talked only about software engineers but I truly believe that
the same applies for most of the IT field and probably in many other
professions that feel threatened by <strong>AI</strong>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Everyone</strong> will have to <strong>adopt</strong> to a new way of working where <strong>AI</strong> will be the catalyst
for reaching new levels of <strong>productivity</strong>. Eliminating the human factor
at all does not seem so simple at this point.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_inevitable_change">The inevitable change</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Mankind through the centuries has faced many groundbreaking discoveries that changed the way we think and work. It is expected some professions that exist today to be <strong>obsolete in the future</strong> and other professions that we can’t even <strong>imagine</strong> will be very popular.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I don’t really believe that the demand for human workers will be significantly decreased.
In the industrial revolution there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite">similar</a> fears
but eventually the demand for workers was increased and the standard of living
was improved(<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industrial-revolution.asp">1</a>. <a href="https://www.accountancysa.org.za/the-stages-of-industrial-revolution-and-its-impact-on-jobs/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_dialogue/---act_emp/documents/presentation/wcms_582793.pdf">3</a>).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I don&#8217;t want to <em>sugarcoat</em> things. Every change has <strong>winners</strong> and <strong>losers</strong>.
I don&#8217;t think however that <em>technology is good or bad</em>. <strong>AI</strong> was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_fiction">prophetized</a>
in popular fiction many decades now and I believe that it is up to us as
a <strong>society</strong> to make the best out of it and remind to the companies that
investing on it that it is something that <strong>impacts everyone</strong>.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Generative AI</strong> is not something <strong>new</strong>. Now it has <strong>matured</strong> enough and we are able to see its application <strong>everywhere</strong>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Eventually this will <strong>affect</strong> the way we work and live. Change and adoption needs time though. Only <strong>few pioneer companies</strong> will get <strong>affected</strong> for the <strong>next few years</strong>. Most companies will adopt it <strong>gradually</strong> and we need <strong>many years</strong> until it re-shapes the field.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Today’s IT professionals <strong>don’t have to fear for their jobs</strong>. They will need to adapt to new ways of working but replacing professionals with <strong>AI</strong> is an exercise for the <strong>very distant future</strong>. Even then, it is most probable that new jobs that we can’t predict at the moment will emerge.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I hope my <strong>predictions</strong> to prove accurate. Please, let me know if you have any different thought on the matter!</p></div>
